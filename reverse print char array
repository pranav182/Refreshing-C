/* Your program should first read the total number of names (an integer) in order to know how many index cards need to be processed

correctly, that is on one line, the last name followed by one space, followed by the first name.  Your program should print the reversed 
name immediately after reading the patron's names (ie, it should not wait until it has read all of the index cards to begin printing). */
