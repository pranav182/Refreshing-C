/* Step1 : initialise all variables and char array 
Step2: Create an array to store length and initialise all its elements to zero
step3: take input of total noof words (int)
step4: using that input as for loop, take input of sentence, but its taken as word one by one
step5: count noof letters in input word one by one in while loop
step6: use the initialised array to input counted number into the array
step7: print the word with its length then get out of for loop
step:8 use another for loop to print the frequency */
